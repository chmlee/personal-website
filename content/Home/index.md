I am an undergraduate stuying Political Science and Mathematics in University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I'm interested in comparative politics and political methodology. In particular, I study ethnic identification with both formal modeling and statitical analysis.

I am also a research assistant of Cline Center for Advance Social Research, working on Composition of Religious and Ethnic Group (CREG) Project.
