Do you hear the people sing? Singing the song of angry men. This is the music of the people who will not be slaved again. When the beatings fo your heart, echoes the beatings of your heart. There is a life about to come when tomorrow comes.

Will you join in our crusade? Who will be strong and stand with me? Beyong the barricade, is there a world you long to see? Than join in the fight that will give you the right to be free?
